Weather Data

To improve my understanding of data handling with Python and Numpy I will be doing this weather data project.
Numpy library of SciPY stack has functions which help to manage data in array form. I will load NOAA station and temperature data from text files. Plot them visually to understand insights from the data. I will be doing comparison's with different locations and parameters.

This graph shows the comparison of the warmest year in Barcelona with the Coldest year in San Diego
